# üéÆ ZeroTier Gaming Fix
**Automatically fixes ZeroTier network settings for seamless LAN gaming!**  

When using **ZeroTier for LAN gaming**, some users experience issues where players **cannot see each other in-game**. This happens because **Windows resets network settings(!)** upon reconnecting, affecting:  
‚úÖ **Network adapter metrics**  
‚úÖ **Firewall profile (public/private)**  
‚úÖ **Broadcast traffic for game discovery**  

This tool ensures that **ZeroTier works flawlessly for LAN gaming**, even after reconnections.

---

## üöÄ Why is this needed?
Many games rely on **LAN discovery via broadcast packets**. Windows often **resets key network settings(!)** when reconnecting to ZeroTier, which prevents proper LAN discovery.  
This fix:
- Ensures **LAN broadcast works**, so game lobbies are always visible.
- Forces **ZeroTier as the top-priority network adapter**.
- Automatically **corrects Windows firewall settings** to allow LAN traffic.
- Prioritizes IPv4 over IPv6. this prioritization ensures that LAN games (which often don‚Äôt support IPv6) will use IPv4 whenever possible.

### ‚úÖ Features:
‚úî **Auto-fix for ZeroTier adapter settings**  
‚úî **Runs automatically in the background**  
‚úî **No need to manually adjust settings**  
‚úî **Works on Windows 10 & 11**

## üì• Installation

### **Step 1: Download & Extract**
1. **Download the latest ZIP** from the [Releases](https://github.com/gomaaz/Zerotier_Gaming_Fix/releases) page.  
2. Extract the ZIP file (`Zerotier_Gaming_Fix_vX.X_Win11.zip`).  

### **Step 2: Install the Fix**
1. Open the extracted folder **`Zerotier_Gaming_Fix_vX.X_Win11`**.
2. **Right-click `install_zerotier_gaming_fix.bat` ‚Üí Run as Administrator**.  
3. The fix will:
   - Copy necessary files to `C:\zerotier_fix`
   - Install an automated scheduled task, triggered by a zerotier network (re-)connect
   - Apply the correct network settings for those interfaces
   - Set IPv6 prefix policies to prioritize IPv4 over IPv6 as a workaround, since IPv6 cannot be disabled via shell commands for ZeroTier adapters.

---

## üõ† Uninstallation
If you want to remove the fix:
1. **Right-click `uninstall_zerotier_gaming_fix.bat` ‚Üí Run as Administrator**.
2. This will:
   - Remove the scheduled task
   - restore ipv6 prefix policies  
   - Delete `C:\zerotier_fix`

---

## üîß How It Works
1. **Checks if the ZeroTier adapter metric is correct** (`Metric = 1`).
2. **Ensures Windows firewall allows LAN traffic** by setting the ZeroTier network to **Private**.
3. **Adds a broadcast route (`255.255.255.255`)** to enable LAN discovery.
4. **Set ipv6 policies** to prefer ipv4 over ipv6.
5. **Runs automatically** whenever ZeroTier reconnects - for existing and all future zerotier networks.

---

## ‚úÖ Verify its working
- You can always check your whole adapter settings with the script 
`Check_Network_interfaces.bat` in resources folder. (Run as administrator)
Whith this, you can check if metrics, firewall and ipv6 prefix policies are correctly set to your zerotier interfaces.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Troubleshooting
- **Run the installer as Administrator** to apply settings correctly.
- Check if ping to the devices is working `ping <zerotier-client-ip>`
- is a `DIRECT` connection to each peer working? Check with powershell (as administrator) and type `zerotier-cli.bat peers`
- If your firewall is **blocking LAN traffic**, manually check the **Windows Defender settings**.
- If LAN discovery still doesn‚Äôt work, verify that **Multicast & Broadcast are enabled in ZeroTier Central**.
- If Discovery still doesnt work you can have a look at [Winipbroadcast-1.6](https://github.com/dechamps/WinIPBroadcast/releases/tag/winipbroadcast-1.6)
- In Zerotier dashboard, set managed routes `255.255.255.255/32 via 0.0.0.0` and `224.0.0.0/4 via 0.0.0.0`)
- Consider running a own Zerotier controller with [ZTNET](https://ztnet.network/) since you can adjust MTU Sizes (1400 eg.) for gaming optimization and unlimited Devices.

## üéÆ Considerations for Gaming with Linux and Mac Friends  

When playing with friends on **Linux or macOS**, there are additional steps required to ensure **LAN discovery works properly over ZeroTier**.

By default, **broadcast traffic is not automatically routed over the ZeroTier adapter** on macOS and Linux. To fix this, you need to **manually add a broadcast route**.

Like so

`sudo route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev my_zerotier_interface`

Replace `my_zerotier_interface` with the actual name of your ZeroTier adapter.

For this find your interface whith on Linux:

```sh on Linux (shell)
ip addr
```

on mac (with Terminal)
```sh on mac
ifconfig
```

then enter the command with the device ID printed in the output above
```sh with ztkseq3i6h as example device ID
sudo route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev ztkseq3i6h
```
